e) Preserves the details of the various issues and keep an eye on their returns.

## **BENEFITS:**
a) Simple and Easy to Use.

b) Increased Library management

c) Efficient Cloud data management.

d) Highly Secure,scalable and Reliable.

e) Mobile Access.

f) Error-free

## **4W'S and 1H:**

### Who
This Library Management is an application used by all the students, and staff who are having recognized id's.

### What:
Library Management Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & record books borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates.

### When:

### How:
This project is implemented to do the book issuing, return,adding or renewal purpose by entering the student or faculty id as input.

## **Swot Analysis:**

### Strengths:
a) Fully Customizable

b) Innovation.

c) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 

d) Mobile Access.  

e) Cost effective

### Weakness:
a) Copyright

b) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.

c) Risk of computer virus

d) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.

e) Speed of Access.

## Opportunities:
The system helps you to find the fine levied by automatically counting days from the date of issue in case of late return of the book. Easy to generate a customized report for library items, library inventory, and library fine collection.
The LMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required tonavigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

### Threats:
The risk of not preserving the collections from the physical degradation inherent in each of the various media the Library holds, and from deterioration through use; and.The risk of exposing the items in the collection to theft, mutilation, or accidental loss.
Libraries now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
